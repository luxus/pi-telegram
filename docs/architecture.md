# Telegram Bridge Architecture

## Purpose

`pi-telegram` is a session-local π extension that binds one Telegram DM to one running π session. It owns the Telegram bridge boundary:

- Poll Telegram updates and enforce single-user pairing.
- Translate Telegram text, callbacks, media, and files into π turns.
- Stream previews and deliver final π responses back to Telegram.
- Provide Telegram-native controls for queueing, model/thinking/settings menus, compaction, abort/stop, prompt templates, reactions, and outbound artifacts.

This document is the architectural map. Focused behavior standards live in sibling docs:

- [Public API](./public-api.md) — stable commands, config, package entrypoints, assistant markup, extension APIs, and compatibility boundaries.
- [UI Style](./ui-style.md) — inline UI labels, navigation, state markers, cards, and dialogs.
- [Callback Namespaces](./callback-namespaces.md) — callback prefix ownership and fallback rules.
- [Sections](./sections.md) — structured Telegram menu sections.
- [Updates](./updates.md) — update classification, default-routing plans, and raw Telegram update interception.
- [Voice Integration](./voice.md) — voice reply policy and STT/TTS provider surface.
- [Command Templates](./command-templates.md) — shell-free command-template contract.

## Runtime Topology

`index.ts` is the only composition root. It wires live π ports, Telegram Bot API ports, session-local stores, lifecycle hooks, and domain runtimes. Reusable logic lives in flat `/lib/*.ts` domain modules rather than a deep local module tree.

The repository uses a **Flat Domain DAG**:

- Local imports must form a directed acyclic graph.
- Cohesive domain files are preferred over atomizing every helper.
- Shared buckets such as `lib/constants.ts` or `lib/types.ts` are avoided.
- Constants and state types live with their owning domain.
- Narrow structural projections are allowed when they avoid importing broader runtime or wire DTOs.
- Source file headers include `Zones:` tags so cross-cutting responsibility stays visible without folder nesting.

### Domain Ownership Map

- `index.ts`: composition root for live ports, session state, transport adapters, and lifecycle registration.
- `api`: Bot API helpers, retries, uploads/downloads, temp cleanup, byte limits, chat actions, lazy token clients, and API error recording.
- `config` / `setup`: `telegram.json`, bot token setup, first-user pairing, authorization, env fallback, atomic persistence, and live config accessors.
- `locks` / `polling`: singleton polling ownership, takeover/restart behavior, long-poll controller state, offset persistence, and poll-loop wiring.
- `updates` / `routing`: update classification, authorization planning, callbacks, edited messages, reactions, and inbound route composition.
- `media` / `text-groups` / `time-injection` / `turns` / `inbound`: inbound text/media/file extraction, media-group debounce, long-text coalescing, optional `[time]` context, handler execution, and prompt-turn assembly/editing.
- `queue`: queue item contracts, lane admission/order, readiness gates, mutations, dispatch runtime, prompt/control enqueueing, and session/agent/tool lifecycle sequencing.
- `runtime`: session-local coordination primitives: counters, flags, setup guard, abort handler, typing timers, dispatch flags, and reset binding.
- `model` / `menu-model` / `menu-thinking` / `menu-status` / `menu-queue` / `menu-settings` / `menu` / `commands`: model identity, thinking levels, scoped model handling, menu render/callback behavior, slash commands, bot commands, and interactive controls.
- `sections`: Telegram menu-section registry, opaque section callback tokens, render/callback dispatch, safe section ports, and diagnostics.
- `keyboard`: shared inline-keyboard reply-markup shape only; feature domains own labels, callback data, and behavior.
- `preview` / `replies` / `rendering`: streaming preview lifecycle, final reply delivery, reply parameters, Telegram HTML rendering, chunking, and stable preview snapshots.
- `outbound`: outbound text transformations, assistant-authored action comments, voice/button artifacts, and generated callback actions.
- `outbound-attachments`: `telegram_attach`, queued outbound files, stat/limit checks, and photo/document delivery classification.
- `status`: status bar/status-message rendering, queue-lane summaries, redacted event ring, and grouped diagnostics.
- `lifecycle` / `prompts` / `prompt-templates` / `pi`: π hook registration, Telegram prompt guidance, prompt-template discovery/expansion, and centralized direct π SDK imports.
- `command-templates`: shell-free command-template helpers, composition expansion, placeholder substitution, executable resolution, warnings, and retry/timeout semantics.

### Guarded Invariants

Architecture invariant tests protect:

- Acyclic local imports.
- Direct π SDK imports centralized in the `pi` adapter.
- `index.ts` as a composition root without local runtime adapter logic.
- Runtime state isolation from local domain imports.
- Structural leaf-domain isolation.
- Menu/model boundary direction.
- API/config separation.
- Media/update/API decoupling.
- Outbound attachment isolation from queue, inbound media, and API helpers.

Mirrored domain regressions live in `/tests/*.test.ts`. Shared test fixtures should exist only when multiple suites genuinely reuse them.

## Configuration And Ownership

Telegram configuration lives in `~/.pi/agent/telegram.json`. Polling ownership lives separately in `~/.pi/agent/locks.json` under `@llblab/pi-telegram`.

### Setup Flow

`/telegram-setup` progressively resolves the bot token:

1. Use the locally saved token when present.
2. Otherwise use the first supported Telegram token environment variable.
3. Otherwise show the example placeholder.

`ctx.ui.input()` only supports placeholder text, so setup uses `ctx.ui.editor()` when a real default must appear already filled in. Persisted config is written through a private temp file plus atomic rename and left with `0600` permissions.

### Runtime Ownership

- `/telegram-connect` acquires or moves singleton ownership before polling starts.
- `/telegram-disconnect` stops polling and releases ownership.
- Session start resumes polling only when the existing lock already points at the current `pid`/`cwd`, or when a stale same-`cwd` lock can be safely replaced after process restart.
- Session replacement suspends polling/watchers without releasing ownership so the next session-start hook in the same process can resume.
- Live polling owners require explicit takeover confirmation.
- Long-lived timers use snapshotted ownership context and stop local polling when the lock no longer points at their own process.

Deleting `locks.json` resets runtime ownership without deleting Telegram configuration.

## Core Flows

### Inbound Turn Flow

1. Poll updates through `getUpdates`.
2. Persist update offsets only after successful handling; repeated handler failures are bounded.
3. Filter to the paired private user.
4. Dispatch owned callbacks and controls before fallback prompt forwarding.
5. Coalesce media groups and likely split long text when needed.
6. Download files into `~/.pi/agent/tmp/telegram` with size limits and partial-download cleanup.
7. Run configured/programmatic inbound handlers in order, appending successful stdout under `[outputs]`.
8. Add local attachments under `[attachments]`, optional voice context, and optional final `[time]` context.
9. Build a `PendingTelegramTurn` and append it to the bridge queue.
10. Handle `edited_message` updates separately while the original turn is still queued.
11. Dispatch only when all safety gates are clear.

Long-text split recovery is intentionally conservative: only human text at or above the near-limit threshold opens the debounce window; commands, bots, captions, media groups, and normal short follow-ups bypass it.

### Queue And Dispatch Safety

The bridge keeps its own Telegram queue. Queue items have two explicit dimensions:

- `kind`: `prompt` or `control`.
- `queueLane`: `control`, `priority`, or `default`.

Dispatch rank:

1. `control` lane.
2. `priority` prompt lane.
3. `default` prompt lane.

Admission and planning validate lane contracts. Invalid lane/kind pairings fail predictably instead of being silently coerced.

Dispatch requires:

- No active Telegram turn.
- No pending Telegram dispatch already sent to π.
- No compaction in progress.
- `ctx.isIdle()` is true.
- `ctx.hasPendingMessages()` is false.

A dispatched prompt remains queued until `agent_start` consumes it. This keeps the active Telegram turn bound for previews, attachments, aborts, and final replies.

Post-agent-end queue dispatch uses a session-bound deferred dispatcher. It is activated on session start, clears timers on shutdown, and skips callbacks from older generations before touching `ExtensionContext`.

### Controls And Menus

Telegram controls execute through command/callback domains, not by entering the normal prompt queue unless they intentionally create a prompt turn.

Immediate controls:

- `/start` opens the main inline application menu.
- `/model`, `/thinking`, `/queue`, and `/settings` are hidden shortcuts to menu sections.
- `/compact` opens an inline confirmation dialog and then runs compaction when the bridge is idle.
- `/next` dispatches the next queued turn, aborting π first when needed.
- `/abort` aborts the active Telegram-owned run while preserving queued items.
- `/stop` aborts and clears waiting Telegram queue items.

Queued controls:

- `/continue` creates a priority Telegram-owned `continue` prompt.
- Prompt-template commands expand Telegram-safe π template aliases before entering the prompt queue.
- Model-switch continuation uses the control lane when an in-flight Telegram-owned run must be stopped and resumed.

UI label, navigation, tab, toggle, card, and dialog rules are defined in [UI Style](./ui-style.md). Callback prefix ownership is defined in [Callback Namespaces](./callback-namespaces.md).

### Compaction And Typing Status

Manual `/compact` requires inline confirmation because accidental taps are disruptive. Auto-compaction and confirmed manual compaction both:

- Set the bridge compaction flag.
- Block queued prompt dispatch.
- Update status to `compacting`.
- Start Telegram native `typing` keepalive.
- Stop typing on compact completion, timeout fallback, or session shutdown.

During active Telegram-owned turns, assistant message start/update hooks re-arm typing so transient provider/model errors do not leave a continuing run without Telegram activity feedback.

### Rendering And Delivery

Telegram replies are rendered as Telegram HTML, not raw Markdown. The renderer is Telegram-specific and regression-prone.

Key guarantees:

- Real code blocks stay literal and escaped.
- Supported absolute links stay clickable; unsupported links degrade safely.
- Markdown tables render as compact monospace blocks and count grapheme/display width.
- Lists, task lists, quotes, headings, and blank-line spacing have Telegram-specific preservation rules.
- Long replies are chunked below Telegram limits with balanced HTML where possible.
- Streaming previews prefer stable rich blocks and append the unstable tail conservatively as readable plain text.
- Preview flushes are serialized so older edits cannot race newer snapshots.

Final delivery attaches reply metadata only where requested. Reply parameters apply only to the first chunk of split messages; continuation chunks are adjacent normal messages. Media-group turns reply to the representative message id.

### Outbound Artifacts And Assistant Actions

Outbound files are delivered after the active Telegram turn completes. They must be staged with `telegram_attach`, are checked atomically per tool call, and use configurable size limits before photo/document upload.

Assistant-authored final-message actions use hidden top-level comments:

- `telegram_voice` creates voice reply artifacts through configured outbound handlers, programmatic voice handlers, or registered synthesis providers.
- `telegram_button` creates inline buttons whose callbacks enqueue the configured prompt text as a normal Telegram prompt turn.

Preview rendering strips top-level action comments while streaming. Comments inside code fences, quotes, lists, or indented examples stay literal.

Unknown callback data outside owned prefixes is forwarded as `[callback] <data>` only after built-in and extension handlers decline it.

## Extension Surfaces

`pi-telegram` intentionally owns one `getUpdates` loop per bot. `polling` owns that internal loop; `updates` owns classification/default-routing plans plus the public handler registry layered extensions use to observe or consume updates without opening a competing polling connection. Layered extensions should integrate through extension surfaces instead of polling the same bot independently.

- Raw update observation/consumption: [Updates](./updates.md).
- Structured inline UI sections: [Sections](./sections.md).
- Callback namespace discipline: [Callback Namespaces](./callback-namespaces.md).
- Voice/STT/TTS providers: [Voice Integration](./voice.md).
- Inbound/outbound command-template handlers: [Command Templates](./command-templates.md).

Extension callbacks must avoid `pi-telegram` owned prefixes such as `compact:`, `tgbtn:`, `menu:`, `model:`, `thinking:`, `status:`, `queue:`, `settings:`, and `section:`.

## Diagnostics And Operational Behavior

Status rendering distinguishes connected, active, dispatching, queued, tool-running, model-switching, and compacting states. If a queue mutation removes the last waiting item while Telegram-owned work still has running tools, status remains active instead of degrading to connected.

Queue reactions are shortcut controls for waiting turns. Promotion reactions (`👍`, `⚡️`, `❤️`, `🕊`, `🔥`) move prompts to priority; removal reactions (`👎`, `👻`, `💔`, `💩`, `🗑`) remove waiting turns because ordinary Telegram DM deletions are not exposed through Bot API polling.

`/telegram-status` records grouped diagnostics for transport/API, polling/update, prompt dispatch, controls, typing, compaction, setup, session lifecycle, attachment queue/delivery, and recent redacted runtime events. Expected preview noise such as unchanged edit responses is filtered out.

When proactive push is enabled, successful local non-Telegram final replies are sent to the paired chat. Local prompt text is not mirrored because the bot does not own terminal user messages.

Telegram prompt guidance asks assistants to keep dense mobile-visible text around 37 display cells where possible, because emoji and wide Unicode make raw character counts misleading.

## In-Flight Model Switching

When `/model` is used during an active Telegram-owned run, the bridge can emulate π's interactive stop/switch/continue workflow:

1. Apply the selected model immediately.
2. Queue or stage a synthetic Telegram continuation turn.
3. Abort the active Telegram turn immediately, or wait for the current tool to finish before aborting.
4. Dispatch the continuation after abort completion.

This is limited to Telegram-owned runs. If π is busy with non-Telegram work, the bridge refuses the switch instead of hijacking unrelated activity.
